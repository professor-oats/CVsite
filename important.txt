About making your shaders/shaderMaterial
You kind of need to use useMemo so we don't recreate a full uniform on each render
when we want to update any of its properties:

Overall it seems effy to make shaders coupled with React, which I experienced also.
Best approach would be to make renders fully in a solid Vite with Three.js.

Also. To make changed for the current object that we have memoized we need
to approach the uniform with get and set.
